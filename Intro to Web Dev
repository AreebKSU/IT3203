        <h2>The Evolution of the World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web has changed a lot since it was first created in 1989. It has become an important part of almost every person’s life. I would like to speak about its growth, focusing on HTML, and how these changes have impacted the web and our world today.</p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web in 1989, with the drive to help scientists share info easily with each other. The first website was completed in 1991, which allowed for people to access information online. Initially the web, aka “web 1.0”, had simple pages made using HTML, and was used mostly to give information.</p>
        <p>HTML was modified in the late 90s, making it easier for content organization. By the 2000s the web was made for more interactions, allowing more people to share their own content and chat online. Websites like YouTube became very popular around this time. Continuous advancements on HTML helped make websites look cooler and work smoother.</p>
        <p>The web we use today is called Web 3.0 or “The Smart Web”. HTML5 came out around 2014 which helped improve the way websites work by making it easier for most people to upload videos and audios without the need for extra software. Most of us take these advancements for granted, I'm sure.</p>
        <p>HTML is an integral part of our web because it helps organize text, images, links, etc making the website look prettier and work smoother. The developments made on HTML have also boosted up its capability by making it more user-friendly and interactive, as well as helping websites look decent on mobile devices as well. HTML5 has also added tools like web storage, geolocation, etc making it very useful. Thanks to HTML, we have easy access to information, entertainment, shopping platforms, and more, while also being simple and fun to use, not only on PCs or laptops, but on mobile devices and tablets as well.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the World Wide Web has changed a lot since it was first invented in 1989. HTML has played a huge role in its changes by changing the web into a more attractive and user-friendly platform. As technology advances, I’m sure the web will become cooler and better than ever before.</p>

        <h2>Analysis of HTML and CSS in the W3.CSS Template</h2>
        <p>In this analysis I will be examining the use of HTML and CSS in a W3.CSS template from W3Schools while keeping in mind its structure, organization, and implementation. My focus will primarily be on three aspects: The use of semantic tags, the role of CSS styles and selectors, and lastly the responsiveness of the template itself. Finally, in this analysis I have summarized the main things I learned from reviewing the code.</p>
        <p>The template I have chosen uses multiple HTML5 elements to create a well-organized and readable chunk of code. Even though I didn’t notice any elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, or &lt;article&gt;, it uses &lt;nav&gt; for the sidebar part and &lt;footer&gt; for the footer of the webpage. The &lt;nav&gt; element, I think, helps the viewers in identifying any components to navigate through the web page while also helping the users to access things on it with much ease. The &lt;div&gt; elements have also quite frequently been used from my observation and some perhaps could be replaced by semantic alternatives such as &lt;section&gt; to enhance clarity.</p>
        <p>Another cool thing I noticed is that the &lt;meta&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt; section were used to define attributes. Doing so contributes to a better user experience on different kinds of devices. Some &lt;link&gt; elements are also used to include stuff externally to beautify the design of the template.</p>
        <p>I have also observed that the CSS is primarily imported by &lt;link&gt; elements. This is probably to reduce the need for lots of inline styles. An internal &lt;style&gt; block is used however to customize specific elements. All in all, this template uses W3.CSS quite extensively, which could possibly limit customization options if the website designer wanted to modify the webpage beyond the capabilities of the framework used.</p>
        <p>One of the things I really like about this template is its responsiveness and ease of use. The use of the W3.CSS grid system and flex-based layouts helps it conform to different screen sizes. The &lt;meta name="viewport"&gt; tag ensures the page scales properly on phones as well. While going through this template I discovered valuable insights regarding effective web design such as framework integration, code organization, and responsive design principles.</p>
