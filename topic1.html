        <h2>The Evolution of the World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web has transformed dramatically since its creation in 1989 and has become an essential part of everyday life. This article explores the web’s evolution, with a particular focus on HTML and how these changes have shaped our digital world.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web to help scientists share information more efficiently. The first website launched in 1991, allowing people to access content online. This early version, known as “Web 1.0,” consisted of simple HTML pages used primarily for informational purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML was refined in the late 1990s, improving the organization and presentation of web content. By the early 2000s, the web shifted toward interactivity, giving users the ability to share their own content and engage in communication. Popular platforms like YouTube emerged during this era. Continued improvements in HTML enabled websites to become more visually appealing and functionally robust.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today’s web, often referred to as Web 3.0 or “The Smart Web,” was significantly enhanced by the introduction of HTML5 around 2014. HTML5 improved multimedia support, enabling users to upload videos and audio without relying on external plugins. These features, though now taken for granted, have greatly simplified web interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML is a cornerstone of the modern web, responsible for structuring text, images, links, and more. Its ongoing development has made websites more user-friendly, interactive, and responsive across all devices. HTML5 introduced features such as local storage, geolocation, and better mobile compatibility, making modern web experiences richer and more accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, the World Wide Web has evolved from a simple information-sharing platform to a powerful, interactive, and user-friendly space. HTML has played a key role in this transformation, and as technology continues to advance, we can expect the web to become even more dynamic and immersive.
