        <h2>The Evolution of the World Wide Web</h2>
        <p>The World Wide Web has changed a lot since it was first created in 1989. It has become an important part of almost every person’s life. I would like to speak about its growth, focusing on HTML, and how these changes have impacted the web and our world today.</p>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a computer scientist, invented the World Wide Web in 1989, with the drive to help scientists share info easily with each other. The first website was completed in 1991, which allowed for people to access information online. Initially the web, aka “web 1.0”, had simple pages made using HTML, and was used mostly to give information.</p>
        <p>HTML was modified in the late 90s, making it easier for content organization. By the 2000s the web was made for more interactions, allowing more people to share their own content and chat online. Websites like YouTube became very popular around this time. Continuous advancements on HTML helped make websites look cooler and work smoother.</p>
        <p>The web we use today is called Web 3.0 or “The Smart Web”. HTML5 came out around 2014 which helped improve the way websites work by making it easier for most people to upload videos and audios without the need for extra software. Most of us take these advancements for granted, I'm sure.</p>
        <p>HTML is an integral part of our web because it helps organize text, images, links, etc making the website look prettier and work smoother. The developments made on HTML have also boosted up its capability by making it more user-friendly and interactive, as well as helping websites look decent on mobile devices as well. HTML5 has also added tools like web storage, geolocation, etc making it very useful. Thanks to HTML, we have easy access to information, entertainment, shopping platforms, and more, while also being simple and fun to use, not only on PCs or laptops, but on mobile devices and tablets as well.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the World Wide Web has changed a lot since it was first invented in 1989. HTML has played a huge role in its changes by changing the web into a more attractive and user-friendly platform. As technology advances, I’m sure the web will become cooler and better than ever before.</p>
